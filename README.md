# 📊 Data Manipulation with Pandas

Hey there! 👋  
This repo contains all my notes, code, and practice work related to **data manipulation using Pandas** in Python. I've explored everything from loading datasets to performing complex operations like merging, grouping, cleaning, and visualizing data.

I created this as part of my learning journey while working on real-world datasets and improving my data analysis skills using the Pandas library.
